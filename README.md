## Agent Vs Ghosts
This has all the relevant files for my pygame project, Agent Vs Ghosts. This includes the script and remains of the executing process.
You can unzip and file from here to play, but I suggest to just download the executable from my Project's Page (https://torrinconrath.github.io/) as you won't need to worry about the unnecessary files.

# How to Play?

Throughout this game, you will need to dodge and shoot the incoming ghosts. You move around with WASD and shoot with the arrow keys. You have three hearts meaning you can get hit three times before the game is over. As time goes on, the ghosts will spawn faster and faster until it is impossible to continue.

# Powerups

* Lightning: The player doubles their speed.
* Cannon: No matter which arrow key the player clicks, it will shoot bullets in all four directions.
* Bomb: A bomb will start counting down and after five seconds will wipe all the ghosts on the map.
* Infection: When the player shoots the enemy, it will spawn a zombie at the previously killed enemy's place. It will act as a dummy drawing some of the ghosts' attention to it.
* Shield: The player will gain a shield which can absorb a hit.
* Star: The player turn into a saiyan becoming invincible, doubling their speed, and shooting gold bullets in all directions.
* Honey: The enemies will have their speeds cut in half.
* Firecracker: The player will shoot rockets, which will explode when in proximity with an enemy.
